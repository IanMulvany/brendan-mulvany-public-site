# Public Site Configuration Example
# Copy this file to config.yaml or config.local.yaml and update with your settings

# Security settings
security:
  # IMPORTANT: Generate a secure random JWT secret for production
  # Example: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
  jwt_secret: "CHANGE-ME-generate-a-secure-random-secret-key-here"

# Storage configuration
# Controls where images are stored (local for testing, R2 for production)
storage:
  # Storage backend type: 'local' or 'r2'
  type: local

  # Local storage settings (for testing/mocking R2)
  # Use relative path or set to your local storage directory
  base_path: "./storage-test"

  # R2 storage settings (for production - not yet implemented)
  # Uncomment and configure when ready to use R2:
  # type: r2
  # account_id: "your-cloudflare-account-id"
  # access_key_id: "your-r2-access-key-id"
  # secret_access_key: "your-r2-secret-access-key"
  # bucket_name: "your-bucket-name"
  # public_url: "https://your-cdn-domain.com"  # Optional CDN URL

# Similarity search configuration
similarity:
  # Hamming distance threshold for finding similar images
  # Perceptual hashes are 64-bit (16 hex characters)
  # Recommended thresholds:
  #   - 0-3: Very similar (same image, minor compression differences)
  #   - 4-6: Similar (same scene, different processing/crops)
  #   - 7-10: Somewhat similar (related scenes, same location/event)
  #   - 11-16: Less similar (may include false positives)
  # Default: 8 (good balance for "roughly similar but not exact" images)
  threshold: 13
